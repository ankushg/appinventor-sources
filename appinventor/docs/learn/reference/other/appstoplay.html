        Uploading Apps to Google Play
       </h1>
       Applications built with App Inventor can be uploaded to Google Play!
       <dl>

        <h2>Version Your App</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
          Every app you publish must have a <code>VersionCode</code> and a
          <code>VersionName</code>. You can set these in the designer under the
          properties panel for the <code>Screen1</code> component.
         </p>
         <p>
          <code>VersionCode</code> is an integer value that will not be visible to
          Google Play Store users. It is used by other apps to check if your app
          has been upgraded or downgraded. It defaults to 1 and should be increased by
          one with every successive change whether it is a major change or a minor change.
         </p>
         <p>
          <code>VersionName</code> is a String which can be anything you would like. It is
          defaulted to 1.0. A common structure is a decimal number which is
          increased by 1 for every major change and 0.1 for every minor change. For example,
          an initial <code>VersionName</code> could be 1.0 which can be updated to 1.1 after
          a small change and 2.0 after a larger change.
         </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <h2>Download <code>.apk</code></h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
            Once you are done making your app, you can download your Android
            <code>.apk</code>
            file as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          1. Navigate to the home screen of the app you want to download in App Inventor<br />
          2. Click the dropdown labled “Package for phone”<br />
          3. Click “Download to This Computer”<br />
         </p>
         <p>
         This will prompt you to save the application somewhere. Once you have the .apk downloaded, you are ready to publish this app to Google Play.
         </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <h2>Publish Your App</h2>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <p>
            You can now go to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/Home">Google Play Publishing Home</a> and follow the steps to publish your app to Google Play.
